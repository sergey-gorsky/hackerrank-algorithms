Here are some solutions to hackerrank challenges that I want to show off

| Challenge Title       | Links                | Comments             |
| ----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Two Characters        | [Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/two-characters/problem) <br/> [Solution](https://github.com/lucask42/hackerrank-algorithms/blob/master/Two-Characters.js) | Thinking this was an easy problem I spent a long time making two big ugly messy non-working solutions without writing any tests.  After taking a deep breath I started over and applied TDD and I cut straight to a working and satisfying solution.
| Caesar-Cipher         | [Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/caesar-cipher-1/problem) <br/> [Solution](https://github.com/lucask42/hackerrank-algorithms/blob/master/Caesar-Cipher.js) | The classic cipher.  This solution can accept offsets that are greater and 26 and less than -26.
| Mars Exploration      | [Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mars-exploration/problem) <br/> [Solution](https://github.com/lucask42/hackerrank-algorithms/blob/master/Mars-Exploration.js) 
| Sherlock and the <br/> Valid String | [Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-valid-string/problem) <br/> [Solution](https://github.com/lucask42/hackerrank-algorithms/blob/master/Sherlock-and-the-Valid-String.js) | I was able to reuse work from other solutions and I also implemented unit tests ensure the several functions in this algorithm work as expected.
| Best and Worst Records | [Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/breaking-best-and-worst-records/problem) <br/> [Solution](https://github.com/lucask42/hackerrank-algorithms/blob/master/Best-And-Worst-Records.js) | Straightforward use case of Array.reduce
